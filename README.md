*OBSOLETE* EasyWebSocket make this one oboslete

To update/init all the dependancies

$ sh deps.sh


NOTES
-----
* Currently xmiters are done via normal jQuery Get. and Recvers are done via

* If both used socket.io ?
  * echoer will be simpler
  * no jquery dependancy
  * would be bidirectionnal
* this is is there a CON ?
